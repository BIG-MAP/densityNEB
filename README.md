# torch_neb
Code for calculating the path of least resistance between two points in a scalar field using nudged elastic band.

The method is described in our paper [Accelerated Autonomous Workflow For Antiperovskite-based Solid State Electrolytes](https://dx.doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1780345/v1)

Parts of the code is based on [Pytorch-AutoNEB](https://github.com/fdraxler/PyTorch-AutoNEB)
